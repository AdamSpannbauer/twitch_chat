The ones you have it with presume you are good, and can do what they need as a team. The ones you dont have synergy with presume you are bad.

18:58 < totalmayhem64> @thegodjames First of all, m2k is like the only example. Hbox and others who play both games do not have that, so m2k is an outlier. Second, Melee came out way before Smash 4, so it's VERY unlikely that a player would start with Smash 4 and go to Melee. I will say though Zero and Esam have had success in Melee

19:23 < wx_bombadil> Melee isn't a party game? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a game with such an ability to be fun in a party setting? Melee puts party games on another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a game with this skill and passion for party activities again. Street Fighter breaks records. Mortal Combat breaks records. Melee breaks the pinata. You can keep your formal wear. I prefer the confetti.

21:20 < lolm2kxd> @Lemzi So, u-tilt is an upward tilt attack, f-tilt is a forward tilt attack (like Mario's not very strong kick), and d-tilt is a downward tilt attack. All characters have 1 of each. I hope this explains it well combined with the other message I sent. :3

M2K puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the rap game again. Armada breaks records. Mang0 goes to tourneys as falcon. M2K spits fire. You can keep your relatives. I prefer the Rap2King.

22:49 < timid_one_> why did armada and wizzy drop out?
22:49 < hammerface80> I didnt see it, was m2k's fox not on point or was hbox playing amazing?

22:49 < tctignor> did the stream just finish
22:49 < dirty50> hungry box didn't win smash 4 idiots
22:49 < freshlemons74> @timid_one_, armada dropped out for "family issues" and wizzy left because he needed to play breath of the wild
22:50 < vegetaz0> the stream finished a few mines ago

22:50 < solarspartan710> BotW Kreygasm
22:50 < vegetaz0> gothic hes messing with ya
22:50 < rafah247> @gothic_aesthetic Hobx was playing ok and m2k looked kinda down after a few games even tho he was playing pretty well in my opinion.
22:50 < gothic_aesthetic> ik
22:50 < pinballwizard00> Wizzy sure loves Zelda
22:50 < dirty50> zelda overrated
22:50 < gothic_aesthetic> @rafah247, yeah i bet he lost some momentum after losing in winners
22:51 < fynmorph> when wizzy, armada and mango could have beaten hbox but decides to drop out ResidentSleeper
22:51 < vegetaz0> Zelda botw best game
22:51 < solarspartan710> @PinballWizard00 Well Wizzrobe is a character from the Zelda universe
22:51 < thegnomessb> @hammerface80, m2k's fox was looking pretty damn clean, but hbox was just outplaying him. he ended up switching from fox to marth last game but it didn't work out
22:51 < pinballwizard00> I know
22:51 < dirty50> watched the whole game
22:51 < linkitcraig> wait is it over? i fell asleep

22:51 < solarspartan710> @dirty50 But Zelda sucks in every smash game Keepo
22:51 < pinballwizard00> But can't he just take the Switch with him so he plays Zelda?
22:51 < gothic_aesthetic> m2k was so tilted on the last stock of winners that he suicided
22:51 < legume1412> @Fynmorph Mango beating HBox LUL

22:52 < gothic_aesthetic> i say good for juan imo he does more than bairs and fairs with jiggs now so he deserves it
22:52 < solarspartan710> What do you mean Hbox again. He didn't win a major since EVO. If you can call this a major.
22:52 < lucisorel> y
22:52 < lilpastry73> Last.
22:52 < canusurvive> this tourny was like an hbox donation drive
22:52 < thelocoxomg> Last.
22:52 < link0232> lol
22:52 < pinballwizard00> Nah, more like a regional

22:53 < rafah247> The hypest part of the whole melee tournament in my opinion was the drunksloth comeback last game 2-2
22:53 < canusurvive> only lost 1 game
22:53 < diamond44444444> drunksloth Kreygasm
22:53 < thelocoxomg> dizkidboogie > drunksloth
