13:04 < believeblood> yep
13:04 < kimpachis> yeah
13:04 < kalle29_mb> ye
13:05 < smashstudios> did Weston go fox or falco?
13:05 < believeblood> west went all fox
13:05 < lemoncat55> yea he almost 4 stocked him g5
13:05 < scoolice> anyone know what wes vs army is?
13:05 < scoolice> or wes vs chu?
13:05 < scoolice> wes having a icies problem??
13:05 < kimpachis> i feel the wes can only beat spacies
13:06 < kimpachis> in his stream the cpu are always fox or falco
13:06 < believeblood> I feel like west is only consistent against spacies
13:07 < roogy__> alex19W
13:07 < rdkelly> wes has 0 problems beating s2j 90% of the time, i think he's consistent against fast fallers in general
13:07 < rdkelly> he's definitely not consistent against sheik, peach, puff, icies
13:07 < scoolice> Wes cant beat floaties
13:07 < smashstudios> Wait. Numbers almost 4 stocked wes game 5?!!!
13:07 < youngbebop> West doesn't play well against samus either
13:07 < scoolice> but marth?
13:08 < youngbebop> yes
13:08 < scoolice> wes beats marth
13:08 < scoolice> thats it tho right
13:08 < scoolice> every other floaty is hard for him?
13:08 < youngbebop> wes played horrible in that last game
13:08 < kimpachis> no last summit wes took duck yo ga
13:08 < kimpachis> game 5
13:08 < lemoncat55> @SmashStudios, numners couldve but he was swagging last stock
13:08 < lemoncat55> numbers
13:08 < smashstudios> Looks like we need to go back to the drawing board vs floaties
13:09 < believeblood> Never met a falco that was super consistent. RIP PPMD
13:09 < impostercauster> PPMD Kreygasm
13:09 < youngbebop> PPMD falco is so nasty
13:09 < smashstudios> Dont worry westblaallz fans. Wes will jam the floaties sooner than later
13:09 < believeblood> PPMD keeps blue balling us
13:09 < thescariestfish> heyyyy
13:10 < ninjagamer1234> m e m e
13:10 < youngbebop> honestly, I don't know if he will ever come back
13:10 < espinilio2> I\press 1 if you want pp's ballz in your mouth
13:10 < believeblood> almost 3 months since genesis and still no update?
13:10 < saepoo112> tfw no ppmd
13:10 < blalabblalab> how long until it starts guys?

13:10 < mr_bones__> @saepoo112, for realllll
13:10 < blalabblalab> cool
13:10 < racgiman> thanks
13:10 < espinilio2> plebs
13:10 < yeexexe> I wish the best for PPMD
13:10 < impostercauster> He'll come around soon enough. Might even be this month o3o
13:11 < believeblood> @ImposterCauster I've heard that story before
13:11 < espinilio2> I hope pp doesnt come back because he's been spending most of his time with me
13:11 < youngbebop> All I know is that if we still had PP and Hax$, The competition would be a lot crazier
13:11 < mas_1> when does today's stream start?
13:11 < espinilio2> if he comes back, ill b lonely
13:11 < espinilio2> and miss his ballz in ma mouth
13:11 < believeblood> starts in like 49 minutes
13:11 < thegravytrainttk> PP coming back means that Marth haters saying Marth isn't good will have to hold that L
13:11 < scoolice> ppmdThink
13:11 < scoolice> @TheGravyTrainTTK what if he comes back as falco only?
13:11 < believeblood> @TheGravyTrainTTK hope it's the same with falco haters
13:12 < saepoo112> who says Marth isnät good?
13:12 < thegravytrainttk> Like Phil claiming Marth isn't top 4 because Samus can live to 200 every stock
13:12 < scoolice> What if pp comes back a falcon main?
13:12 < espinilio2> What if pp comes back and sucks ass?
13:12 < scoolice> Reverse Hax$
13:12 < thegravytrainttk> Like it don't matter how long they live if they can't touch me
13:12 < impostercauster> If PP comes back with a different main, it'll 100% be Doc
13:12 < believeblood> Phil is an outlier most people put marth at 3rd or second
13:12 < thegravytrainttk> I know
13:12 < victorhawk123> @Espinilio2 he did Battle of the five guys
13:12 < espinilio2> And marth haters get more leverage
13:12 < espinilio2> yea and he wasnt that great
13:12 < espinilio2> he was ok
13:12 < espinilio2> but not top 10
13:12 < racgiman> PPMD's marth always gave me such high expectations for marth
13:12 < elmandinga69> whisper me hentai
13:12 < espinilio2> maybe top 15
13:13 < thegravytrainttk> If he came back as a Falco only (which he won't), I would be ok with it
13:13 < caffink8> how long til it starts?
13:13 < believeblood> I would love falco only PPMD Kreygasm
13:13 < lemoncat55> 45 mins
13:13 < kimpachis> @victorhawk123 thats because of his health problems on day 1 he rektd everyone
13:13 < racgiman> it'll start in about 47 minutes
13:13 < thegravytrainttk> Because then all the Falco haters/doubters that don't think Falco can do it against Floaties because of Mango and Westballz will have to hold that L
13:13 < thegravytrainttk> Same thing
13:13 < wigwam23> falco is just underdeveloped
13:14 < espinilio2> PPMD overrated
13:14 < thesolution1506> PP could pull off single maining Falco, I'd love to see that Kreygasm
13:14 < thegravytrainttk> PP won't be instantly good when he comes back, but I doubt it would take longer than 3 months to get to top 10 level again
13:14 < alfredguy> press 1 if you're easily influenced by mob mentality because it's fun to be part of the in group and since everyone else is pressing 1 it's probably the right thing for you to do as well
13:14 < thegravytrainttk> @Espinilio2 You new to the scene
13:14 < espinilio2> lol no
13:14 < thegravytrainttk> Only logical explanation
13:14 < thesolution1506> @TheGravyTrainTTK agreed
13:14 < thegravytrainttk> Or trolling
13:14 < espinilio2> He hasn't played in forever
13:14 < espinilio2> consistently
13:14 < believeblood> I think that the rest of falco's development has to do with things that aren't 0 to death combos, so most falco mains are like "I'm good."
13:15 < espinilio2> I mean he's good
13:15 < espinilio2> but not as good as everyone's saying
13:15 < thegravytrainttk> And by new, I mean came into the scene after he started his long abscenses
13:15 < wigwam23> ppl play falco stupid
13:15 < espinilio2> nah dude
13:15 < espinilio2> 2013
13:15 < espinilio2> almost 4 years
13:15 < thegravytrainttk> 2014 PP is Kreygasm
13:15 < thegravytrainttk> I don't get how that isn't obvious
13:15 < racgiman> I mean. Leffen PPMD in 2015 and went to game 5 (ppmd won)
13:15 < racgiman> (apex)
13:16 < espinilio2> I guess but you can't hold the past to the present
13:16 < espinilio2> the meta has moved on without him
13:16 < mas_1> He's been watching though
13:16 < thegravytrainttk> Look at Leffen, its less extreme
13:16 < mas_1> maybe doing some serious analytics
13:16 < believeblood> eh ppmd has had long absences before and still came back to win tournaments. I wouldn't be suprised if he came back and was instantly a top 10 player
13:16 < espinilio2> but he hasnt been playing with high calibur opponents
13:16 < thegravytrainttk> But he said he was surprised how much shorter it took to get back into it than he thought
13:16 < alfredguy> clearly we don't understand the concept of learning as a lone wolf
13:16 < espinilio2> yea but people werent getting better at the same rate
13:16 < saepoo112> ppmd's regimen didn't really consist of playing other top players, he mostly does mental stuff, "theorycrafting" etc
13:17 < shiroeofloghorizon> when is it starting?
13:17 < thegravytrainttk> 40ish minutes
13:17 < espinilio2> esports money is motivating people to get better faster
13:17 < l2username> dam
13:17 < l2username> why so late
13:17 < racgiman> TBF leffen came back from his sorta-absence and had some shaky tourneys, but then he also had a tourney where he beat what, all the gods who were attending?
13:17 < l2username> i need me some melee
13:17 < racgiman> @L2username timezones.
13:17 < espinilio2> pacific time maing
13:17 < thegravytrainttk> It always starts at 11
13:17 < mas_1> It's definitely hard to say, but if anybody can come out of a long hiatus with improvement it's probably PP
13:17 < thegravytrainttk> PST Kreygasm
13:17 < mas_1> It's kind of the way he plays
13:17 < espinilio2> i think hax moreso
13:17 < espinilio2> hes actually grinding
13:17 < espinilio2> and came to summit
13:17 < ddotr> ETA till live?
13:17 < mas_1> You're probably right about Hax
13:17 < thegravytrainttk> I'm not saying its guarenteed that he comes back and is instantly top 10
13:18 < saepoo112> @RacgiMan that was actually in the middle of his absence, in a tourney in Canada which he was allowed to go to. He gave up a couple of months after that
13:18 < thegravytrainttk> I'm just saying that after 2 events, I would be surprised if he isn't at a top 20 level
13:18 < believeblood> hax won't be good again for a long time becuase of the new controller
13:18 < espinilio2> fair enough gravy
13:18 < notorly> pikaPower
13:18 < thegravytrainttk> And after that he will likely continue to rise
13:18 < espinilio2> true that
13:18 < mawacate> when is this starting?
13:18 < thesolution1506> PP talked about the "meta escaping him" in his interview with tafo. He said if his abscence had been or 2013 and 2014 it'd be another story, but for 2015 and 2016 he doesn't think the meta has grown nearly fast enough for him not to be able to catch up in a couple months
13:18 < thegravytrainttk> Not necessarily to what he once was, but at least close
13:18 < holyfriedmonkey> pp has some of the best neutral and movement in neutral ever. hes not gettin rusty anytime soon if condition disappears
13:18 < niceman2525> when does it start
13:18 < ddotr> @notorly PI KAPOW ER
13:18 < espinilio2> I'm just saying a lot of ppl are saying he'll be top 5 instantly
13:19 < thegravytrainttk> Starts in 40 minutes
13:19 < niceman2525> thx
13:19 < thegravytrainttk> Oh fair enough
13:19 < racgiman> @saepoo112 fair enough
13:19 < holyfriedmonkey> mayB
13:19 < believeblood> I won't believe it until I see it
13:19 < espinilio2> twitch chat argument settled lol
13:19 < thegravytrainttk> I'm hoping he is in form and competitive by Big House
13:19 < princealimd> pp will never make a full return lets be real here
13:19 < espinilio2> lel
13:19 < espinilio2> thats a possibility
13:19 < holyfriedmonkey> lol
13:19 < xerosyx> whens summit
13:19 < thesolution1506> mid march return of pp callin it Kreygasm
13:19 < pfhorthewin> ye of little faith
13:20 < bojilster> is there a confirmed time for PPMD to come back?
13:20 < saepoo112> yfw he returns tomorrow
13:20 < notorly> he will be top 5 instantly because of the mindgame that he's ppmd
13:20 < racgiman> nah
13:20 < thegravytrainttk> I don't wanna get my hopes up, so that is why I'm hoping for a summer return and him back in shape by fall
13:20 < stevenk4> mydick
13:20 < pfhorthewin> remember when armada retired?
13:20 < espinilio2> yea but that was before esports money
13:20 < thegravytrainttk> I personally wasn't around, but what about it
13:20 < nlkyo> armada should retire again for the sake of melee
13:20 < pfhorthewin> and everyone was like "he won't be as good" when he came back
13:20 < thesolution1506> What if he arrives at summit tomorrow once Armada wins, announces his return, challenges Armada on the spot to a grudge match and 6-0s him Kreygasm
13:21 < thegravytrainttk> That was also a 6 month gap between apex and evo
13:21 < stevenk4> mangoTEAM mangoBEER
13:21 < cluelessdorito> why isnt mango playing in singles?
13:21 < ddotr> He isnt?
13:21 < cjfast11> WE LIVE YET?
13:21 < espinilio2> yea because people started trying harder around the time he came back
13:21 < espinilio2> because esports
13:21 < cluelessdorito> yeah look at the vods
13:21 < believeblood> @thesolution1506 The script demands it
13:21 < holyfriedmonkey> pp could easily go top 15 but back to 5 is hard lmao we only got 1 person to have done it
13:21 < thegravytrainttk> than like a 9ish month gap (?) between Evo and attending EU events
13:21 < cluelessdorito> mango only played in doubles
13:21 < pfhorthewin> remember that time when PPMD hadn't been playing and won APEX 2015
13:21 < saepoo112> singles hasn't started yet
13:21 < ddotr> I dont think we're done singles
13:22 < espinilio2> ok but he's been on a 2 year hiatus pretty much
13:22 < imesire> came too early hmmmm
13:22 < jinwoooooooo> who's PP?
13:22 < cluelessdorito> singles bracket was yesterday tho?
13:22 < thegravytrainttk> To be fair, if Apex happened 3 or 6 months later, i think Armada would have beaten PP
13:22 < ddotr> @JINWOOOOOOOO nice bait
13:22 < cluelessdorito> not finished just getting placings
13:22 < espinilio2> that's the longest hiatus he's had
13:22 < smeoldan2> only 2 pools were played, there are four
13:22 < racgiman> single's isn't over we just had seeding thingies
13:22 < thegravytrainttk> PPMD @JINWOOOOOOOO You trolling?
13:22 < saepoo112> oh my B
13:22 < smeoldan2> oh yea it was seeding
13:22 < holyfriedmonkey> pretty sure its doubles rn
13:22 < cluelessdorito> yeah mango wasnt in that bracket so hes not doing singles
13:22 < impostercauster> Armada and HBox group phase was yesterday. Mango/m2k groups today
13:22 < jinwoooooooo> never heard of him before. is he good?
13:22 < mcfroob> !schedule

13:23 < believeblood> @JINWOOOOOOOO he was one of the best players only to take a hiatus because of mental health issues.
13:23 < cluelessdorito> i dont think ppmd will ever come back in full form again
13:23 < trillstirner> wtf why only vod for day 1 but not day 2? BibleThump
13:23 < cluelessdorito> changing your brain chemistry is really bad for melee
13:23 < thegravytrainttk> I can see the vod for day 2
13:23 < jinwoooooooo> Kappa
13:23 < xbibimbapx> @cluelessdorito sssssshh

13:23 < cluelessdorito> im not hating im just being realistic
13:23 < ddotr> @JINWOOOOOOOO He's a stupid sperg who no one likes because he has astigmatism and wants to kill himself. He's also fat and has no jawline
13:23 < keoryn> but its split
13:23 < thegravytrainttk> It says "watch beyondthesummits last broadcast"

13:24 < c0lourspace> Thanks guys, be back in 36 min then.
13:25 < racgiman> I called the voting for final 3 in the mafia yesterday
13:25 < thegravytrainttk> I watched the first 5 minutes blind and I had to look at the roles, it was too weird
13:25 < believeblood> 11:00PST 2:00EST if you aren't east or west coast you're somewhere in between.
13:25 < racgiman> central would be 1
13:25 < cluelessdorito> poor chu
13:25 < theblake378> Thanks
13:25 < trillstirner> @Keoryn u said there was link to day 2 vod?
13:25 < telicity> lets go boys
13:25 < cluelessdorito> hes the most honest player there lol
13:25 < m4ttaroni> lets go hbox
13:25 < thegravytrainttk> In other news, if Scar is on the couch for top 4 doubles I am going to throw something
13:25 < cluelessdorito> im not sure if hes been mafia once
13:25 < thegravytrainttk> That was so painful to watch
13:25 < racgiman> Hax / Mango commentary Kreygasm
13:25 < believeblood> Scar is not a good doubles commentator
13:25 < keoryn> @trillstirner there is not 1 vod for day 2, its split
13:25 < wigwam23> is s2j gonna go 0-2 again
13:25 < cluelessdorito> scar is always one of my fav commentator though
13:25 < trillstirner> split?
13:25 < thegravytrainttk> He ignored a 2 v 1 comeback to talk to HugS about mafia
13:26 < keoryn> @trillstirner u can check individual matches for day 2 but not 1 entire video for the day
13:26 < cluelessdorito> he should be there for entertainment
13:26 < trillstirner> o shit were they going offline

13:26 < trillstirner> gotcha
13:26 < thegravytrainttk> @wigwam23 Again? He has done it once
13:26 < believeblood> @cluelessdorito in singles he's amazing hype man, but in doubles not so much
13:26 < theblake378> At least with 4 commentators scar is less controlling of commentary
13:26 < thegravytrainttk> Saying again implies it happens a bunch
13:26 < krisseok> android is my brudder
13:26 < believeblood> What smartphone does armada have?
13:26 < thegravytrainttk> @TheBlake378 With Lovage and Hugs on the couch, it didn't seem to matter

13:27 < thegravytrainttk> Shoutouts to SFAT being a moron in mafia last night
13:27 < racgiman> in about 33 minutes
13:27 < keoryn> lel
13:27 < cluelessdorito> armada was fucking brutal last night
13:27 < icytime> aight tyty
13:27 < keoryn> sfat wasnt so bad
13:27 < racgiman> shoutouts to zhu the real big idiot last night
13:27 < cluelessdorito> calling people idiotsa
13:27 < believeblood> He was sort of right though
13:27 < keoryn> d1 was terrible and zhu were terrible
13:27 < thegravytrainttk> "I think it is pretty obvious that Armada is the cop"
13:27 < krisseok> Armada's has two phones, android and anIOlaS
13:27 < hawkofglory> !start
13:27 < thegravytrainttk> Like wtf
13:27 < racgiman> I think twitch was right that zhu forgot his role
13:27 < nukethestars> CoolCat
13:27 < cluelessdorito> d1 is my favorite mafia player tho
13:27 < cluelessdorito> so entertaining watching him melt down hahaha
13:28 < keoryn> @cluelessdorito he was horrible yesterday though
13:28 < thegravytrainttk> @RacgiMan He did tweet that he forgot he was vigi
13:28 < cluelessdorito> yeah but i mean entertainment wise
13:28 < racgiman> LMAO
13:28 < keoryn> @cluelessdorito he helped take out mango
13:28 < believeblood> No one had any reason to believe zhu was the vig
13:28 < hemshy> mango had the sickest reads
13:28 < believeblood> might not have worked anyways
13:28 < maxbradyanderson> when are they online
13:28 < cluelessdorito> i dont really care who wins, just want funny matches
13:28 < racgiman> True but he didn't even try the claim when the hugs hbox medic thing was going around
13:28 < cluelessdorito> mafia matches*
13:28 < stardiamond1> chu is a legend
13:28 < stardiamond1> just know that
13:28 < racgiman> Which would've probably been a safe time since that would've been 3 confirmed town
13:28 < cluelessdorito> has chu been mafia once
13:28 < hemshy> no
13:28 < believeblood> chu is secretly a genius at mafia, zhu messed up
13:28 < cluelessdorito> hes too pure to be mafia
13:29 < theblake378> Chu was honestly playing the best he could
13:29 < theblake378> with what he had
13:29 < keoryn> @Believeblood a lot of people messed up
13:29 < cluelessdorito> i want to see him play as mafia, thatd be interesting how he handles it
13:29 < keoryn> not only zhu
13:29 < keoryn> a lot of people
13:29 < believeblood> @Keoryn fair
13:29 < racgiman> okay but scar got wrecked because of alex talking at night
13:29 < racgiman> lets be fair
13:29 < astrovix> zhu should have said he was vigi
13:29 < arqueotm> i dunno chu could have done a lot more things right
13:29 < theblake378> Chu would either be a god or the worst mafia lol
13:29 < cluelessdorito> i think its easy for us to say they suck, but if youre actually playing without knowledge, its a lot more difficult
13:29 < arqueotm> but it was rly zhu who fucked up
13:29 < nukethestars> Chu throws out obvious statements just to gauge reactions. It's not a bad strategy.
13:29 < theblake378> Honestly, crunch played good too, wasn't obvious about it.
13:30 < cluelessdorito> crunch was a legend
13:30 < kamensky1> What time ?
13:30 < theblake378> and HMW threw people off from the start which set it up.
13:30 < jonaswiklund> does anyone know how long until it starts?
13:30 < arqueotm> i don't think crunch played well honestly
13:30 < cluelessdorito> first time playing mafia and he was analyst all the way
13:30 < keoryn> crunch didnt play so good
13:30 < arqueotm> i think everyone else played like shit
13:30 < racgiman> Crunch played okay and he ruined it at the end but zhu totally missed that he was backpeddling hard
13:30 < keoryn> town just played horrible
13:30 < thegravytrainttk> @NukeTheStars Especially if he coupled it with Armada's statement that people who have stuff to hide have a hard time smiling
13:30 < theblake378> @JonasWiklund 2:00 EST, like 35 mins
13:30 < arqueotm> he didn't talk until there were like less than 8 ppl
13:30 < keoryn> crunch was doing ok
13:30 < twitchnotify> 2 viewers resubscribed while you were away!
13:30 < jonaswiklund> @TheBlake378, okay thanks
13:30 < keoryn> everyone was just shit
13:30 < blinkarchon> when does stream start?
13:30 < keoryn> d1 took out mango
13:30 < hemshy> no mango had the sick reads lol
13:30 < theblake378> Crunch did enough to win so
13:30 < astrovix> also hugo played good but he revealed medic too early
13:30 < cluelessdorito> i think people were unused to crunch, and just assumed he was normally quiet
13:30 < og_arrighetto> When does it start today?
13:30 < thegravytrainttk> They just went live for a few seconds
13:30 < cluelessdorito> so it didnt look out of the ordinary
13:30 < believeblood> Speed mafia with the top 6 Kreygasm Kreygasm.
13:30 < astrovix> PogChamp
13:30 < theblake378> mang0 guessed half the people left alive that doesn't count lol

13:31 < 13thomas> 30 min to go MingLee
13:31 < theblake378> last dope peach Kreygasm
13:31 < racgiman> mafia meta: never kill d1 he'll probably just break down and ruin it for the town
13:31 < cluelessdorito> lol
13:31 < 13thomas> mehdiABORT

13:50 < troykotobuki> beer pong hype
13:50 < cluelessdorito> like i said before, if PP came back he wouldnt be able to reach top 4 again
13:50 < cavalierxyz> @TheMoon112 Yeah I never played it myself, asked my waifu and she evidently used to play tons of it in middle school. We're planning on doing a game of it at our next party type shindig.

13:51 < veetaak> ICE IS IN FIRE
13:51 < rustlebonez> numbers went from unranked to miom top 50 in one year so its fair that he got in
13:51 < nukethestars> InfiniteNumbers is the highest ranked meme pick. It stands to reason he would do well.
13:51 < gamertilldeath1337> Infinite Numbers is undefeated against Socal EleGiggle
13:51 < billygowhoop7> mafia last night was sick
13:51 < theblake378> @Believeblood in fairness though, s2j would almost definitely beat numbers.
13:51 < ifxy> song name?
13:51 < papyrustv> Theres only been one mafia game right guys??

13:57 < mang0_pie> How fucking dare you question the people's champ. Do you have any idea how sick Scar was in his prime. This national treasure got 5th at Genesis 2. He has the complete right to gloat about the past. We will honestly never see another falcon like him. All the attack and movements that Falcon does should be called the Scar in my personal opinion. Take your shit to smash 4 kiddo.

13:58 < randowboosh> Now, I have been using Ganondorf against my brother lately, and he cannot seem to beat me. We think we know why, and we think it puts Ganon at the top of the tiers. I will be brief.Ganondorf has his air forward. We call it 'The Punch.' It has that special hitbox like a sword, hence it goes right through anything except an attack with that same type of hitbox. It does 17% max, is relatively fast executing, has basically instant recovery on a barrier cancel, and is quite massive, killing at rath

Hbox puts the stage in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a actor with his skill and passion for the screen again. Daniel Day Lewis breaks records. Meryl Streep breaks records. Hbox breaks our hearts. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the Juan.

14:13 < zanderwill> Scar's Fox isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability at angles with fox? Scar puts Fox's Up-B in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his firefox and geometry for the game again. mang0 breaks records. Armada breaks records. Scar breaks the angles. You can keep your mangles. I prefer the PeoplesChamp.

14:17  * squashua10 Hbox's acting isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a actor with such an diverse range and emotional spectrum with himself? Hbox puts the stage in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a actor with his presence and gravitas on the screen again. Daniel Day Lewis breaks records. Meryl Streep breaks records. Hbox breaks our hearts. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the Juan.

Natural Energy puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with this kind of diet and lifestyle for the game again. team beer breaks records. Red bull breaks records. Natural Energy breaks the rules. You can keep your GFuel I prefer the magic.

Chu puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Nintendude breaks kings. Wobbles breaks walls. Chudat breaks the rules. You can keep your wobbling. I prefer the super saiyan.

Alex puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. mang0 breaks records. Armada breaks records. Alex19 breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.

Chu puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Nintendude breaks kings. Wobbles breaks walls. Chudat breaks the rules. You can keep your wobbling. I prefer the super saiyan.

Hugo puts missing shots on another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his grey hair and bad back again. mang0 isn't going bald. Armada doesn't have to shave the white hair on his beard. HugS is 30 years old. You can keep your 90s kids. I prefer 1986.

Hugo puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his age and passion for the game again. Mang0 breaks records. Armada breaks records. Hugs breaks his hip. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the years."

M2K puts peach vs icies in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his campiness and patience for the game again. mang0 beats Nintendude. Armada beats every icies. m2k peach breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the camping.

Smash Summit puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever hear again. Genesis breaks records. EVO breaks records. Smash Summit breaks your eardrums. You can keep your ears.

Chu puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Nintendude breaks kings. Wobbles breaks walls. Chudat breaks the rules. You can keep your wobbling. I prefer the super saiyan.

17:40 < twooez> Chudat isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability and knowledge with Ice Climbers? Chu puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Nintendude breaks kings. Wobbles breaks walls. Chudat breaks the rules. You can keep your wobbling. I prefer the super saiyan.

17:40 < hzashimi> "How much pain can one man withstand?" wondered a gloomy SFAT, having just lost another major he said he would win. "This was my time!" he thought while being chaingrabbed by M2K after counterpicking to FD. "What goes around comes around" he muttered as Leffen shinespiked him for the 3-0. "Do I have no one left in this world?!" SFAT cried out as PPU suicide dair'd him during doubles grand finals. And from that day, the flame in poor SFAT's heart slowly faded away.

I thought I would have made it out of pools if I knew how to fucking buffer roll. But they didn't even give me the frames to do it. Bullshit, just straight up bullshit.

18:19 < chazzdex> Alex19 no es tan grande? ¿Me estás tomando el pelo? ¿Cuándo fue la última vez que vio a un jugador con tal habilidad y el movimiento con el zorro? Alex pone el juego en otro nivel, y seremos bendecidos si alguna vez nos vemos a un jugador con su habilidad y pasión por el juego de nuevo. Mang0 rompe registros. Armada rompe registros. Alex19 rompe las reglas. Usted puede mantener sus estadísticas. Yo prefiero la magia.

Alex19 يكسر القواعد. يمكنك الاحتفاظ الإحصاءات الخاصة بك. أنا أفضل السحر.

19:48 < ppuw> Let me take the time to explain this to you and u-mrsamsa very clearly, as I am not sure if you are taking the metaphor literally because you are genuinely stupid, or because you just haven't taken the redpill yet. By "what is happening in our colleges" I meant the Cultural Marxism taking place, that is why I did not find it surprising you were leftwing. "Cuck" indeed has a deep meaning and is not just a "childish" insult, if used carefully.

20:03 < dgamemaster> Super Pilot is Greenlit on Steam and should release sometime this year. Today, we’re talking about its impressive demo. There’s more going on here than in many major titles today. Taking liberal inspiration from F-Zero and Wipeout, the racing in Super Pilot is responsive and exciting. Cutting across a lane feels smooth as butter.

20:20 < fm360> Infinite Numbers isn't so fucking fat? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability to take up a Summit spot with they're fat ass? Infinite Numbers puts the neck beard in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his waistline and blood pressure for the game again. mang0 breaks records. Armada breaks records. Infinite Numbers breaks scales. You can keep your statistics. I prefer stage 2 diabetes.
